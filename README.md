Timelapse of buildig this static site : https://youtu.be/0gIYL1jFjSA

Personal Website hosted on GitHub and deployed via Netlify.
Domain name provider: Namecheap.

It's quite easy and took me about an hour to complete everything from start to finish. Using this approach, only the domain has to be paid for. Would definitely recommend Netlify, check them out here: https://netlify.com/
